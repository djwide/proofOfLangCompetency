/* 
You built a merge function on WPR1 that merges
two already sorted SLists together into one sorted 
SList.  Copy your code into this file if you got
the question correct, otherwise write a working
version of merge.  merge should operate in linear
time.  Now, to complete our mergesort function,
write a function called halves that will take a
an SList as input and return a pair (tuple) of
SLists, each containing a different half of the
original SList.  If there are an odd number of 
elements, it does not matter which half gets the
one extra element.  Feel free to write any helper
functions to help you accomplish your goal.

/*
Once we get a working Heap put together in class
copy the code into this file, so you can use a 
heap to solve the following problem:

Write a function kthBiggest that takes an integer
and a list. Assume that 0â‰¤k<n, where n is the length
of the list. The function should use a Heap to find 
the item that would be at index k if you were to sort
the list in decreasing order. 

For example, kthBiggest(2, List(1,9,3,7,5,8,6,2,4))
would return 7.
 
However, your implementation should not actually sort
the list, because that would be too slow in the common
case that k is much much less than n. Actually sorting
the list would take O(n log n) time, but your function
should run in O(n log k) time. 

For the purposes of this problem, assume that the insert
and deleteMin methods take O(log m) time, where m is the
size of the heap, even if that is not literally true of 
the current implementation.
